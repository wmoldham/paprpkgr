# paprpkgr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of **paprpkgr** is to generate a skeleton to develop a research 
compendium containing the data, analysis, code, and images to reproduce one 
manuscript. I began working ont his package around the same time that the more 
sophisticated [**rrtools**](https://github.com/benmarwick/rrtools) package was being 
developed by Ben Marwick and colleagues. If you are looking to incorporate Docker 
or Travis in your workflows, that package will be more useful to you. 

## Installation

You can install paprpkgr from [GitHub](https://github.com) with either of the 
following:

``` r
devtools::install_github("wmoldham/paprpkgr")
renv::install("wmoldham/paprpkgr")
```

## Getting Started

1. Create a new package using `usethis::create_package()`.
